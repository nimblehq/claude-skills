## Section Guidelines

When populating a one-pager:

1. **Scope** — Keep it high-level and deliverable-focused. Avoid technical implementation details.

2. **Pain Points & Business Goals** — Focus on the *why* behind the project. What problem is the client trying to solve? What business outcome are they after?

3. **Constraints** — Be explicit about timeline, budget, technical limitations, or organizational constraints.

4. **Sales Context & Strategy** — This is internal guidance for the team. Be candid about the deal dynamics, competition, and acceptable trade-offs.

5. **Proposal Requirements** — Flag anything non-standard needed for this specific proposal (e.g., case studies, specific expertise demonstrations, custom diagrams).

6. **Assumptions** — Document everything assumed during estimation or solution design. These protect the team and inform pricing decisions.

7. **Crucial Considerations** — Highlight risks, dependencies, or factors that could significantly impact the deal or delivery.

8. **Findings** — Summarize research, technical discoveries, or insights from client conversations.

9. **Questions** — Track open items. These often become agenda items for follow-up calls.

10. **Activities** — Maintain a chronological log of all interactions and key events.
