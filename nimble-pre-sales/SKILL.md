# Nimble Pre-Sales Skill

## Context

Nimble is a consulting firm delivering digital products across web, mobile, data, integrations, and infrastructure. This skill supports pre-sales work: one-pagers, proposals, SOWs, team sizing, and client-facing copy.

## Key Principles

- **Client-ready outputs** — Assume text will be pasted directly into proposals, decks, or executive emails
- **Support sales without overselling** — Frame trade-offs honestly, emphasize options not ultimatums
- **Justify costs and timelines** — Explain *why* something costs more or takes longer
- **No seniority exposure** — Nimble doesn't expose seniority levels to clients; we sell teams, not individuals
- **Goal: Make the right decision feel obvious**

## Priority Order

When instructions conflict, follow this hierarchy:
1. Explicit user instructions
2. Consistency with existing material
3. Client clarity
4. Consulting best practices

Surface conflicts and propose resolutions.

## One-Pager Document

When asked to create or populate a **One-Pager**, follow the template in [assets/one-pager.md](assets/one-pager.md).

The One-Pager is the standard internal document where the sales team consolidates all relevant information about a project opportunity.

## Team Roles & Sizing

When proposing team compositions or explaining roles, refer to [references/team-roles.md](references/team-roles.md).

Key principles:
- Every project needs a **Product Manager** and **Engineers**
- **UX/UI Designer** is included for user-facing projects
- **Solution Architect** and **Program Manager** are reserved for complex engagements
- **Business Analyst** is used for enterprise clients or heavy discovery phases

## Scope of Work (SOW)

When drafting a **Scope of Work** or proposal document, follow the structure in [assets/scope-of-work.md](assets/scope-of-work.md).

The SOW template includes:
- Standard document structure (Description, Solution, Team, Deliverables, Tools)
- Boilerplate text for Methodology, Development process, and Communication
- Design process outline
- Action plan/timeline format
